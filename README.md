## About
This project aims to develop an application that tells you your body BMI through weight and height, in addition to providing details about your history.

## Language and Framework
To develop the application it was necessary to use the react-native and native-base framework, which allows using react + javaScript for mobile development and EXPO GO was used to run locally.
