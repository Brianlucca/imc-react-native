## About
This project aims to develop an application that tells you your body BMI through weight and height, in addition to providing details about your history.

## Language and Framework
To develop the application it was necessary to use the react-native and native-base framework, which allows using react + javaScript for mobile development and EXPO GO was used to run locally.

## Methods
The project uses react navigation to navigate between pages fluidly and also applies AsyncStorage to insert the imc value and receive the value in a history component

## Customization
To customize the application, an embedded React Native module (StyleSheet) was used, which is customized with JavaScript.
